# Python Tic Tac Toe

## These are Python3 programs to play tic tac toe with two players and against the computer

*Note: game against the computer still in progress

Run the two player program in terminal or command line using: `python3 two_player_tic_tac_toe.py`

- The game instructions are pretty self-explanatory and players are given prompts within the program.
- Might be adding more comments within the code itself later on.
